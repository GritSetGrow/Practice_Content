Project Title: "Azure Data Factory Dataflow Transformation Project"

Project Description: Azure Data Factory Dataflows to perform a comprehensive range of data transformations on the provided Employee and Department datasets. 
The project includes tasks for various transformations and guides students through the process of creating, configuring, and executing data transformations in Azure Data Factory.

Project Tasks:

Project Setup and Data Preparation:

Download the provided Employee and Department datasets (employee.csv and department.csv) and upload them to Azure Data Factory.
Create a new Data Factory project in the Azure portal.


Dataflow Creation:
Create a Dataflow within the Data Factory project.
Configure the source datasets for the Employee and Department datasets.


Transformation 1: Join Operation:
Use a Join transformation to combine data from the Employee and Department datasets based on the "department_id" column.
Choose meaningful columns from both datasets to include in the output.


Transformation 2: Derived Column:
Use the Derived Column transformation to calculate a bonus for employees. For example, calculate the bonus as 10% of the employee's salary.
Include the bonus column in the output.


Transformation 3: Conditional Split:
Create a Conditional Split transformation to categorize employees into High Salary, Medium Salary, and Low Salary groups based on their salary values.
Configure rules for the categorization.


Transformation 4: Window Function:
Use the Window transformation to calculate running averages of employee salaries over time (e.g., monthly averages) based on the "hire_date" column.


Transformation 5: Union:
Implement a Union transformation to combine data from multiple sources or datasets.
For instance, combine the Employee and Department data to create a unified dataset.


Transformation 6: Lookup:
Use the Lookup transformation to enrich the Employee dataset with department information from the Department dataset.
Join data based on the "department_id."


Transformation 7: Aggregate:
Apply an Aggregate transformation to calculate summary statistics or aggregations on specific columns.
Calculate, for example, the average salary per department.

Transformation 8: Pivot:
Utilize the Pivot transformation to transform data from a row-based format to a column-based format.
For example, pivot the data to display salary distribution by department.


Transformation 9: Surrogate Key:
Apply a Surrogate Key transformation to generate unique surrogate keys for records in the Employee dataset.
These keys can be used for identifying and tracking records.


Transformation 10: Filter:
Use the Filter transformation to select a subset of data based on specific conditions.
Filter out, for instance, employees hired after a certain date.


Transformation 11: Sort:
Implement a Sort transformation to order data based on one or more columns.
Sort the dataset based on employee names or hire dates.


Transformation 12: AlterRow:
Utilize the AlterRow transformation to make changes to data based on defined conditions.
For example, adjust salaries for employees who joined before a certain date.


Sink Configuration:
Add a Sink transformation to save the final transformed data into an Azure Storage location, such as a new set of CSV files.
